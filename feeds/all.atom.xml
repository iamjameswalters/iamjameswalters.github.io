&lt;p&gt;I think that people haven't taken the time to explain to beginners the concepts you're thinking about when it comes to deployment. We focus so much on teaching people how to build apps in Django that deployment feels like an afterthought. People are good at making a list of steps, and saying, "Well, here's how &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do it." But if that solution isn't suitable because it uses a provider that won't work for you, or because the steps that worked yesterday don't work today, or for one of any number of reasons, then our beginner is stuck without any way to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if we just took the time to explain what the fundamental things are that you're trying to achieve in deployment, it would help beginners get their feet planted and be able to start figuring out each piece of the process, and what works for them in each part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're here looking for deployment steps, you're at the wrong place. But if you'd like to get the lay of the land, an overview of what deployment's really about, then I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Penguin in the Room üêßÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I'm a &lt;a href="https://james.walters.click/tag/linux-grandpa.html"&gt;Linux Grandpa&lt;/a&gt;, I'm not here to talk about Linux today. I understand a lot of people getting started with Django don't have a lot of familiarity with Linux, and it's a whole new world to get acquainted with, but for the purposes of deployment, it's not so much a concept as it is an implementation detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is just an operating system (more accurately, a family of operating systems). It just runs the computer that's going to be serving your site. That may be different than what you're used to, but it's not an entirely new concept. A new concept that's worth considering for deployment would be the idea of skipping the OS layer altogether (&lt;em&gt;ehhhhhhhh,&lt;/em&gt; sort of) and deploying with a serverless function. But we're going to count that as outside our purview here. If you're capable of considering the pros and cons of going serverless, I think you probably already have a firm grasp of what we're going to get into here. üôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think when it comes to deploying a Django site, you have four overall concerns (and it might be three, depending on what you choose to do):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static Files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WSGI Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also mention a couple of minor concerns as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Static Files üìÅÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that tends to throw beginners for a loop is all of a sudden we start worrying about what to do with static files. What's the deal? I thought Django was handling this for me. &lt;code&gt;{% static %}&lt;/code&gt;, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's going on with static files. These are assets like your images, CSS stylesheets, and scripts. They're called "static" files because they aren't dynamically generated. Most of your Django project's pages are built with templates that get filled in with information by your program on demand when users request the page. That never happens with your images or CSS files. They're just files sitting on disk, ready to be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web servers (like &lt;a href="https://httpd.apache.org/"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nginx.org/en/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt;) were built for the task of taking files on disk and serving them to users. That's where the web started. But we have a Django application because many pages need to be generated on demand with data from the database, we don't have them sitting on disk. A web server can't do that, we need an &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; to generate those files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since these static files aren't generated by your Django app, we don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; Django to handle them. Your Django program is actually way slower than the web server for this job, so we want the web server to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Django does that is it stuffs all the static files into one directory (this will be &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#static-files"&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATIC_ROOT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;). This makes it easy for the web server to look and find the files it needs to serve. Then, we use &lt;code&gt;{% static %}&lt;/code&gt; in our templates to tell Django that the request for this file needs to be passed along directly to the web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the reason all this might seem kind of new is because Django &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been handling static files for you in development. The Django development server (&lt;code&gt;manage.py runserver&lt;/code&gt;) has to handle those requests, because when you're developing locally it's the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; web server available. But when you deploy, you'll have to use a better web server than that, and that server will be quite capable of handling static files on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuring a web server to handle static file requests is beyond the scope of this post, but here's a &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/django-nginx-gunicorn/#serving-static-files-directly-with-nginx"&gt;helpful guide&lt;/a&gt; on the topic. Give it a try! I was pleasantly surprised at how straightforward it was to write an nginx configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've set a &lt;code&gt;STATIC_ROOT&lt;/code&gt; to stuff your static files in, you can actually stuff them there by running &lt;code&gt;manage.py collectstatic&lt;/code&gt;. You'll have to do this anytime you change any of your static files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whitenoise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be the case that for whatever reason you don't have access to be able to configure the web server for your site. In that case, your best option might be to use a tool called &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/whitenoise/"&gt;Whitenoise&lt;/a&gt;. This is a middleware that you can use in your Django app. If you don't know this, a Django request passes through all the different middlewares (listed in &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;), and they each get their turn to do something. The Whitenoise middleware checks to see if the request is for a static file, and if so, it interrupts the rest of the request cycle (which would be slow) and immediately serves up the static file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also opt for this option if you're lazy. But don't&amp;mdash;it still isn't as fast as a web server handling this directly, and configuring nginx really isn't that hard. If you're a web developer, you should understand the tools used to run your code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Media Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth mentioning that the same concerns apply to user-uploaded content, what Django calls "media files". If you have a site where users can e.g. upload a profile picture, you'll want to &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/deployment/checklist/#media-root-and-media-url"&gt;configure these&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Database üíæÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing that you'll have to pay some thought to in deployment is your database situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In development, you've been using a local SQLite file. SQLite is really nifty, because it keeps everything in one single file. Since you don't "connect" to it, you don't have to handle connection details. Your &lt;code&gt;DATABASE&lt;/code&gt; section in &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; is pretty simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In deployment, SQLite may not be suitable (though it's &lt;a href="https://fly.io/blog/sqlite-internals-wal/"&gt;more capable than you're often led to believe&lt;/a&gt;). Generally if you're using some sort of cloud provider, you'll be connecting to a database that's managed for you. This isn't usually different for your app in any material way (though &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/databases/"&gt;databases differ&lt;/a&gt; in both features and limitations), but it is a rather important detail of deployment you need to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important difference will be that you'll need to configure connection details in your &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;. This will mean adding a host address, port, username and password. It'll wind up looking something like this example from the &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#databases"&gt;Django docs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DATABASES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;default&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ENGINE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;django.db.backends.postgresql&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;NAME&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;mydatabase&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;USER&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;mydatabaseuser&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;PASSWORD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;mypassword&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;HOST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;127.0.0.1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;PORT&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;5432&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the plaintext user and password&amp;mdash;we'll return to this topic later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've got your deployment database set up, you'll want to run &lt;code&gt;manage.py migrate&lt;/code&gt; to set it up for the first time, just like you did way back at the beginning of your project to set up SQLite. From that point onward, you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. WSGI Server ü•ÉÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we get to an important lesson in understanding how your Django app &lt;em&gt;actually runs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In development, you've been using &lt;code&gt;manage.py&lt;/code&gt; to run your app. But as the name would suggest, &lt;code&gt;manage.py&lt;/code&gt; is just a management script. How do we run our Django app in a production environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll recall that we talked about having a web server (like nginx) installed. This is the piece of software that receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. Web servers are great at serving files off of the computer's disk. But we have Django apps (or PHP apps, or web apps written in any other language or framework) to generate web pages on demand. So we have a web server that accepts requests and returns responses, and we have a web application that is capable of generating pages on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we get these two things to work together though? The web server just handles files, how do we make it talk to another application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In older days, a standard was defined called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface"&gt;CGI&lt;/a&gt; (or Common Gateway Interface). Basically, the way it worked was when a web server received a request that needed to be handled by the web application, it would call a CGI script (these are usually written in Perl) and pass information about the request as arguments over &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)"&gt;standard input&lt;/a&gt;. That script could the call the web application the way it needed to be called and pass it the appropriate info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python land, we have a similar standard called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface"&gt;WSGI&lt;/a&gt; (or Web Server Gateway Interface). It's usually pronounced &lt;em&gt;whizz-ghee.&lt;/em&gt; The way this works is the web server passes the request over to a WSGI server (like &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/gunicorn/"&gt;gunicorn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/waitress/"&gt;Waitress&lt;/a&gt;). That WSGI server runs a WSGI callable for your application. How on earth do I make that, you ask? Django already did it for you when you ran &lt;code&gt;startproject&lt;/code&gt;&amp;mdash;it's in the &lt;code&gt;wsgi.py&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you need to install a WSGI server, and pass it your &lt;code&gt;wsgi.py&lt;/code&gt; file to run. If you're setting up a virtual machine, you might write a script to run this on boot, or use a &lt;a href="https://vsupalov.com/django-systemd-crashcourse/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; service&lt;/a&gt;. Then, you &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/django-nginx-gunicorn/#incorporating-nginx"&gt;configure the web server&lt;/a&gt; to pass requests over to the WSGI server. The WSGI server will run it through your Django app, and after generating the appropiate page, pass that response back to the web server to hand off to your user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ASGI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also hear about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Server_Gateway_Interface"&gt;ASGI&lt;/a&gt; (azzz-ghee), or the &lt;em&gt;asynchronous&lt;/em&gt; server gateway interface. As asynchronicity becomes easier and more popular in Python and other programming languages, web frameworks are looking to leverage that. Someday soon, this'll become the standard way to run your web app. As far as I understand, it's designed to be pretty similar to WSGI, just asynchronous. As far as your Django deployments go, it'll probably just mean you use &lt;code&gt;asgi.py&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;wsgi.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Web Server üï∏Ô∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've already talked about it a bit, but the last big deployment concern is setting up your web server that will be standing in front of your Django app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we alluded to earlier, &lt;a href="https://httpd.apache.org/"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nginx.org/en/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; are going to be your two main options. Configuring either of them is beyond our scope here. If you don't know which to choose, nginx tends to be more popular these days, on account of how it handles requests within threads (it tends to be more efficient, and thus faster). Apache's a venerable old warhorse though, and it's a perfectly acceptable option. It ran much of the internet of the last two decades or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how you choose to deploy though, you might not need to worry about your web server at all. There are a number of routes to go, but most of the time you'll be looking at either a virtual machine (VM/VPS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual machine (or virtual private server) is basically a rented computer. You can get these from providers like &lt;a href="https://www.linode.com/lp/refer/?r=a4d4d262b7f9176323aa169ee6a142978b235dda"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; (disclaimer: this is a referral link) for as little as $5 a month. This is basically a Linux server that you can SSH into. It'll be a very manual setup process, with little handholding. But, you'll understand every step of the way. If you go this route, you'll be responsible for everything about the server: restarting it if it goes down, tracking and rotating log files, managing security settings and updates, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A platform-as-a-service is kind of different. Basically, the provider will abstract away the underlying computer, and you just focus on your app. You get your code uploaded, provide some details about hooking up a database, static files, where the script to execute is, etc., and you don't have to worry about the server-y stuff like worrying about updates, checking logs, or understanding security settings. You also wouldn't have to configure a web server, the provider would handle that for you. You mostly likely wouldn't even know which web server they're using under the hood. PaaS usually costs a little bit more than a $5 VPS, but if you don't want to become a part-time system administrator, then it's easily worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku is the original platform-as-a-service provider, but they've been in a bit of hot water lately for ending their free tier. I personally don't like it because I think it obfuscates and papers over the issues that I've covered here. &lt;a href="https://testdriven.io/blog/heroku-alternatives/"&gt;Other options abound&lt;/a&gt;. I use a PaaS provider called &lt;a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/"&gt;PythonAnywhere&lt;/a&gt;. I think they've done a good job at keeping the control panels focused on the details we're talking about in this post. They also have a free tier for those just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Code onto the Thing üì¶Ô∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a couple of other minor concerns aside from what we've already mentioned, one of which is how you actually get your code onto the thing you're deploying to. There's a lot of flexibility here. In the old days, it would have been &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;ing the folder from your computer to the server. These days, since most developers are using &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, they just run &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; on the server to pull down the repository (then, you can &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; anytime you make changes to your program). Your provider might even offer you a point-and-click file manager (PythonAnywhere does) and you can just manually upload your code folder that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a number of ways to do it, none of which are very hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Secrets üîíÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing we should mention is handling secrets. You'll remember earlier in our database config our example had the user and password stored right there in &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;. We don't really want to keep sensitive info like that in code, because we don't want it to be commited to version control, like &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;. Even if you have something like a private Github repository, there's a risk of someone getting access to your code. Once you've committed a password to &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, it's basically impossible (not &lt;em&gt;technically,&lt;/em&gt; but it's extremely difficult, and even then it might be too late) to get it out of your repository's commit history. It's better to handle secrets another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two primary schools of thought on this. The older convention for doing this would be to have two &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; files, one for development and one for deployment, which is &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; committed to version control. The way people tend to do this these days is with environment variables, which are pieces of data that are stored in the runtime environment of the computer running your code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to get at environment variables from within a Python script. Personally, I find the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python-decouple&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package straightforward and easy to use. It allows me to store database credentials and my &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#secret-key"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SECRET_KEY&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a file called &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; (which, again, should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; be commited to version control). Then, I can get at those values with &lt;code&gt;decouple.config()&lt;/code&gt;. Options abound though, and find whatever's right for you. Just make sure your secrets aren't committed to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Django's Deployment Checklist ‚úÖÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth mentioning that Django has it's own built-in &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/deployment/checklist/"&gt;deployment checklist&lt;/a&gt; to help you think through some of the things involved in deployment. To use it, just run &lt;code&gt;manage.py check --deploy&lt;/code&gt;, and you'll get feedback on anything that needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;django-simple-deploy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Matthes has a wonderful project going called &lt;a href="https://django-simple-deploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;django-simple-deploy&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to be a utility that you can run against your code, and it will automatically handle all the steps needed to get your code deployed. The idea is not to abstract away the deployment process, but to be something that helps a newcomer get their code online, then they can compare the changes it made to their code settings and learn how exactly it went about it. As of writing, it supports deploying to Fly.io, Platform.sh, and Heroku. More platforms should be on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up üéÅÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of other things we could talk about. Should you containerize your app in a Docker container? Should you deploy with a serverless function? Which database is the best database? These are good next steps to consider. At bare minimum, I hope I've shown that these four major concerns (static files, database, WSGI server, and web server) are the places to begin when figuring out how to deploy your Django application. If you can get your head wrapped around these things, you'll be able to get your app online and make it to "Hello World". The rest are details that you'll pick up as you continue to develop and get comfortable putting your work online.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category><category term="Django"></category><category term="deployment"></category></entry><entry><title>The Road Less Traveled: Understanding XPaths</title><link href="https://james.walters.click/the-road-less-traveled-understanding-xpaths.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>James Walters</name></author><id>tag:james.walters.click,2023-01-26:/the-road-less-traveled-understanding-xpaths.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I started writing a web automation tool to do some chores for me at work.

This was my first time using &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/"&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt;, a handy dandy library for driving web browsers in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to getting a hold of elements in the page you want to interact with, Selenium offers the usual ID and class-based CSS selectors. Since I was trying to navigate a page written in React though, most of that information was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/lucdnp/why_are_class_names_like_this_in_facebook_and/"&gt;randomly generated&lt;/a&gt;. I needed to get at elements by grabbing onto an easily accessible anchor, then using it as a reference point from which to step through the document tree and get at what I was looking for. Since it's 2023, I of course expected to use some facsimile to the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"&gt;Javascript DOM API&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;.parentElement&lt;/code&gt; here, a &lt;code&gt;.firstChild&lt;/code&gt; there, and I'd be able to grab that pesky button nested within three generic &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and click it. &lt;a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/"&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt; works this way, why wouldn't Selenium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, no, Selenium does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work this way. For whatever reason, instead of something resembling the DOM API, Selenium uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath"&gt;XPaths&lt;/a&gt;. When I first started trying to write these things, they struck me as a bit ersatz, landing somewhere along the spectrum between filepaths and regular expressions. But I have to say, they've grown on me a bit, mostly because they're far and away the best tool Selenium gives you for finding elements on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Happy Little (Document) Trees üå≥Ô∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XPaths (the XML Path Language) are based around the idea of seeing the HTML document as a tree of nodes. Let's take the following HTML for our examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-markup"&gt;
&lt;script type="prism-html-markup"&gt; 
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I'd like to welcome you all to this web page. Check out my stuff!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="label"&gt;Things I like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cats&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Video games&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pizza&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;
      &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Enjoy this page?&lt;/span&gt; Let me know!
    &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to write an XPath to target the header at the top of the page, we might write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/html/body/h1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's break that down. The opening slash &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; means the root of the document, the beginning of everything. This is very similar to the root &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory"&gt;UNIX filepaths&lt;/a&gt;. There's only one element in the root of our document: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. So, that's what we type next. Then, within the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, we select the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, and then the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; within it. Because this XPath starts at the root of our document and walks through nodes in the tree to get to the one we want, it's kind of like an absolute filepath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward. But, here's another way we could get at that header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;//h1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's going on here? Whereas the single slash &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; means that what comes after it must be immediately within the node that comes before the slash, the double slash &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; means that it should be &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; inside it. It allows us to find things that are nested a few layers in. So in this case, we're looking for an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that's somewhere within the root of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example of this in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/html/body//span
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This XPath says that in the root of our document there should be a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; node, and within that a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; node. Then, &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; within &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we want a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This would select the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; from our example, even though it's inside a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far our XPaths have only matched one node in our document. But what do we do if we want to select a specific item from a handful of nodes that match our XPath? Let's look at our next example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/html/body/ul/li
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably guessed that this XPath selects an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; node in our unordered list. But which one? That XPath matches all three list items (and left this way, would return them all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use an index to get at a specific node matching the XPath. If we want to select "Video Games", we can modify our XPath this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/html/body/ul/li[2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that XPath indexes are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; like Python indexes&amp;mdash;they start at &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Predicate Predicaments ü§îÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those brackets &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in the last example constitute a predicate clause. They allow you to specify something that should be true about the element your selecting. In this case, we were specifying that the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; we select should be the second child of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other predicates available for us. For instance, we can predicate based on an element's property:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;@id=&amp;#39;label&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This XPath selects a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; node that has an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; property with a value of &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also be wondering, is it possible to select the value of the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; itself? Why yes, you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This XPath would select the value of the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&amp;mdash;that is, it would return the string &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly helpful predicate we can use is checking an element's text with the &lt;code&gt;text()&lt;/code&gt; function. For example, if we wanted to select the list item that says "Cats", we could do so like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;//li[text()=&amp;#39;Cats&amp;#39;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this will only work for an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; match. The entire text must be "Cats". If you want to check if an element's text &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; something, well, you'll need the &lt;code&gt;contains()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/html//p[contains(text(), &amp;#39;like&amp;#39;)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;contains()&lt;/code&gt; function takes two positional arguments: the first for the thing to check, and the second for the value to look for. In this expression, we're looking for a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element whose text contains &lt;code&gt;like&lt;/code&gt;. Since both &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags in our example have the word 'like' in them, they both get selected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predicates can also be chained. If we wanted to narrow down our selection to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;id="label"&lt;/code&gt;, we can add that predicate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;contains(text(), &amp;#39;like&amp;#39;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;@id=&amp;#39;label&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--
Actually, there's another issue lurking here, one that gave me quite a headache.

If we wanted to try and select our button based on it containing the phrase "Let me know!", we might try this:


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;//button[contains(text(), &amp;#39;Let me know!)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



But this won't work. How come?

After some spelunking, I came across a [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3655549/xpath-containstext-some-string-doesnt-work-when-used-with-node-with-more) (of course) that explained it. I'll leave the details of that answer to you, but to sum it up, because the button contains not just text but a `&lt;span&gt;` element as well, `text()` returns a *list* of nodes. We then want to check *each* of those nodes (one of which is the "Let me know!" text) for a match of our string. In order to do that, we need something like this:


--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Additional Resources üìöÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've only scratched the surface of XPath syntax. If you're looking for a deeper dive, I found the cheat sheet at &lt;a href="https://devhints.io/xpath"&gt;devhints.io&lt;/a&gt; incredibly helpful. Not only does it get into a wide variety of XPath syntax, but it also offers some translation between query paradigms you might be more familiar with, such as CSS selectors or JQuery. It has some helpful notes about a few gotchas in there&amp;mdash;think you know how to write an XPath querying an element's class? &lt;a href="https://devhints.io/xpath#class-check"&gt;Think again!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think that the single best tool for wrangling with XPaths is hidden within your browser's devtools. I've yet to check Firefox, but using Chromium-based browsers like Brave and Edge, I learned that you can inspect an element, right-click on it in the code view, and under the "Copy" option, you can copy an XPath for that element. This can help a lot if you're trying to figure out how to write an XPath for something in Selenium! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Right-click to copy an element's XPath" src="https://james.walters.click/images/xpath1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, using Ctrl-F in that inspector will let you test out XPaths and see which elements on the page satisfy it&amp;mdash;just write your XPath in the Ctrl-F dialog and massage it until it selects what you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Type XPath expressions right into Ctrl-F to test" src="https://james.walters.click/images/xpath2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go, a whole different way to navigate HTML documents that was hiding right under our noses. The XPath road may be less traveled than the DOM highway, but I think I might be taking it a little more often from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Web"></category><category term="Selenium"></category><category term="XPaths"></category><category term="Web Scraping"></category><category term="HTML"></category><category term="XML"></category></entry><entry><title>Confessions of a Linux Grandpa: An Oral History #2</title><link href="https://james.walters.click/confessions-of-a-linux-grandpa-an-oral-history-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-10-28T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-10-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>James Walters</name></author><id>tag:james.walters.click,2022-10-28:/confessions-of-a-linux-grandpa-an-oral-history-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello again Sparky!

&lt;p&gt;Now, where did we leave off? Oh yes! I was running Ubuntu on the old Toshiba...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grandpa, what was Ubuntu like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gutsy Gibbon" src="https://james.walters.click/images/ubuntu-7-10-gutsy.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Ubuntu, at the end of 2007. It was just then three years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_7.10_(Gutsy_Gibbon)"&gt;Gutsy&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;span style="color: orange"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, it made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL3c4l6G6pM"&gt;this sound&lt;/a&gt; when you logged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you're looking at there in terms of the desktop is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_2"&gt;GNOME 2&lt;/a&gt;. It offered split panels, one at the top for application menus and launchers (as well as task bar applets), and one on the bottom for window management and virtual desktops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, how I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; those menus&amp;mdash;instead of cramming everything into one Start menu on Windows, here I had three distinct menus: one for applications, one for locations and folders on disk, and one for settings. üòôÔ∏èü§åÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came with Firefox 2, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned previously that my wireless card didn't work on this release: in order to get it working, I had to download the Windows driver from Realtek and install it with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ndis-wrapper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This was a common problem in those days, it would be a few years before the wifi situation improved on Linux. As for this laptop, a driver would make its way into the kernel in the very next release&amp;mdash;it worked out of the box in 8.04 Hardy Heron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of installing stuff, there was no "app store" like there is these days, Ubuntu Software Centre [sic] or GNOME Software or whatever. Back then, you had &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_(software)"&gt;Synaptic Package Manager&lt;/a&gt;, which was itself rather new still. It is, essentially, a graphical browser of the packages in the repositories you were configured to use. I still install it on my machines today&amp;mdash;it's quite handy to have around when you need to look at what's inside a metapackage or don't want to have to reach for &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We called it "bling" ü•áÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a devoted Linux user, I was eager to brandish that identity however I could. You might know of a little computer company in Denver called System76. They've certainly come along way over the last 15 years or so. Back in the day, they would &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430063103/http://system76.com/article_info.php?articles_id=9"&gt;send you some free stickers&lt;/a&gt; if you sent in a self-addressed envelope. They were a parody of the OS badges that computers came with that said "Powered by Windows XP" and the like. Here's what they looked like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Powered by Ubuntu" src="https://james.walters.click/images/powered-by-ubuntu.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sent for mine, I received not only the OS badges, but also some Ubuntu logos for overlaying the &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through"&gt;Windows key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_key_(keyboard_button)"&gt;super key&lt;/a&gt;. üòôÔ∏èü§åÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't have the OS badges anymore, but System76 will &lt;a href="https://system76.com/merch/stickers"&gt;still send you stickers today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went as far as to register this laptop on some list of registered Linux machines I found out there on the web. The home page would list how many registered Linux computers they were tracking. Of course, this was hardly scientific, it was entirely opt-in and who knows who had actually heard of it? I had discovered it through a badge in someone's forum signature containing their "ID number".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, I'm afraid the name and URL of this site have long ago passed from Linux Grandpa's memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the Perils of Dual Booting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll close by sharing an early blunder, perhaps my first with Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing this and playing around with it for a bit, I decided that I wanted to go back to Windows (this laptop came with Vista). This was only my first foray into Linux, and while I enjoyed it, I was ready to return to the safety of home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_formatting#REFORMAT"&gt;nuked and paved&lt;/a&gt; Windows; instead, I installed Ubuntu in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting#Microsoft_Windows_and_Linux"&gt;dual boot&lt;/a&gt; setup. This meant that I split the disk into two partitions: one had Windows, the other Ubuntu. Going back to normal should be as simple as wiping out the Ubuntu side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's exactly what I did. And after completing that operation, I rebooted and...the computer couldn't boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem? The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record"&gt;master boot record&lt;/a&gt; (MBR) was pointing to something that didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master boot record was a little (512 bytes) sector that told the computer where to boot from. As computers (and kernels) grew to become larger and more complex, the MBR would just point to a bootloader, which would take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Windows had made the MBR point to its own bootloader. When I installed Ubuntu, it had to rewrite the MBR to point to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GRUB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which would offer boot options for both Ubuntu and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, when I wiped out my Ubuntu partition, I also wiped out GRUB, which meant that the MBR was pointing to something that didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, with a little Googling, this wasn't &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; difficult to fix: I reached for my trusty Windows install disc, and booted into the recovery utility. From there, I accessed some sort of recovery shell that let me run some command incantation involving a &lt;code&gt;/fixmbr&lt;/code&gt; flag or something, and it repaired the MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this was all long enough ago that computers still used MBRs&amp;mdash;do we still use them on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Disk_device_compatibility"&gt;UEFI&lt;/a&gt; machines? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, this was the first (not the last!) time I got myself out of a Linux pickle. At this early stage, it's a good thing I managed it&amp;mdash;if I'd had to go groveling to my dad and have him fix my computer, he surely would have discouraged me from any further experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this time, Sparky! As a reward for your attention, enjoy yourself another ASCII Original.&lt;/p&gt;

I've &lt;a href="https://james.walters.click/confessions-of-a-linux-grandpa-an-oral-history-1.html"&gt;noted previously&lt;/a&gt; my fascination with operating systems, so I was expecting that the man behind my distro of choice would refer me to a great resource on C. I was a little miffed when he instead pointed me toward Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me, to my surprise and interest, that he had built the fantastic Ubuntu MATE &lt;a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/features/welcome/"&gt;Welcome app&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/"&gt;often imitated&lt;/a&gt;) with Python, along with some webby stuff for the frontend. I didn't walk away from that conversation and go learn Python, but it did sow a seed in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How was your weekend?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often quipped, "I learned Python&amp;mdash;it was a great weekend," on account of the ease with which Python is picked up. I lived a version of that story. My team at work stewards a terrible internal web app that we've dreamed of replacing for years. But, we're not developers. We've &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; developers crop up among our ranks, but that's quite outside the scope of the job. But my manager and I came back around to this conversation late last year, and in a moment of my life where I was battling personal demons in the loneliness and dangerous boredom of working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was ready to dive in when he suggested doing it ourselves with Python and Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a subscription to Codecademy Pro (I think I'd recommend &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/"&gt;RealPython&lt;/a&gt; today if you're looking to learn), and spent the next couple of months hammering at some Python and Django courses. By mid-January, we were ready to break ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Champagne üçæ and Beer üç∫&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of that story is that I'm a Python developer. I continue to explore and learn more about the language, and it's the thing I reach for to solve a problem. So when I started this blog, I felt the need to address, at least briefly, why I like and use Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lots of people are doing that, because Python's great. The internet doesn't need another article about why Python's great. So, I'm trying not to do that here. But what I'd like to do is comment on something that is sometimes (albeit not always) overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember years ago hearing Rachel Ray (I am a cultural dinosaur, you know) talk about being offered her TV show with Food Network. She protested at first, saying "I'm not a good fit, you guys are champagne, I'm beer." But they insisted that was exactly what they liked about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python's kind of the beer of the programming world. I do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; mean by that to say that it is unrefined&amp;mdash;quite to the contrary, the Python community has assembled &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Design_philosophy_and_features"&gt;sophisticated standards&lt;/a&gt; around how code should be written. What I mean is it's accessible; it has an appeal to people that are joining the programming community&amp;mdash;or perhaps, even people who are programming &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of that community&amp;mdash;which other languages do not have. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they're champagne. They're languages written by pie-in-the-sky computer scientists, used by professional programmers who have learned how to think like a programmer, and have &lt;em&gt;un-&lt;/em&gt;learned how to think about programming like a regular person. The average person learning Python today isn't like me, who was happy to learn it for the joy of programming. The average Python beginner is a gradeschooler learning their first programming language, or an accountant who's sick of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications"&gt;VBA&lt;/a&gt;, or a scientist or statistician who just wants to run some quick analysis on some data and get it into a graph. These people aren't programmers by trade, and they don't care about what data type a variable is or why object-oriented programming is great or why you shouldn't manage state that way or how they could have written that &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop more efficiently so that it ran 1048ms faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just want to do something. Python, more than any other language, stays out of the way and lets them do it. It doesn't make them manage memory, it doesn't make them trip on missing semicolons, it doesn't make them read through a bunch of noisy syntax. Whatever someone's trying to do, &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/"&gt;there's at least one obvious way to do it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vive La R√©volution üèÅ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard &lt;a href="https://noumenal.es/"&gt;Carlton Gibson&lt;/a&gt; say at least once on &lt;a href="https://djangochat.com/"&gt;Django Chat&lt;/a&gt; that software development is currently like writing was 500 years ago: the average person would go pay a scribe to write out a letter for them, then they'd send it. But things didn't stay that way: people learned to write for themselves. Today, in the West and in many other wealthier countries, literacy rates are essentially 100%. &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; can write. That doesn't mean that everyone is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at writing, that doesn't mean everyone &lt;em&gt;enjoys&lt;/em&gt; writing, and that doesn't mean that we no longer have a need for professional writers. We have more professional writers than we've ever had. What it means, though, is that when someone needs to write a letter, he can do it himself, without having to pay a scribe to do it. When someone needs to read an important document, he can do so with his own eyes, and he can fill out a form with his own hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the &lt;em&gt;middle&lt;/em&gt; of a technological revolution&amp;mdash;it isn't over yet. Yes, everyone (again, at least in the West and other wealthier places) has a smartphone in their pocket, or a laptop in their backpack, or at least a computer down at the library that they can use each day. But not everyone can program&amp;mdash;not everyone has fluency in the language of the machines they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alsweigart.com/"&gt;Al Sweigart&lt;/a&gt; said something once that struck me as quite profound: people are limited by using software other people wrote. There are two kinds of people: those who look at a computer and say, "Wow, what an advanced machine, full of all this powerful software!" and those who say, "I can make this machine do &lt;em&gt;anything.&lt;/em&gt;" The former are users; the latter, programmers. And Python is the most effective language yet at making users into programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category></entry><entry><title>Confessions of a Linux Grandpa: An Oral History #1</title><link href="https://james.walters.click/confessions-of-a-linux-grandpa-an-oral-history-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>James Walters</name></author><id>tag:james.walters.click,2022-09-13:/confessions-of-a-linux-grandpa-an-oral-history-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Let me spin you a yarn... üß∂ üë¥&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm known to at least one friend as his "Linux grandpa" (I'm fairly certain I coined this phrase myself). We met while working together at my current company. He was (and is) a sharp developer. I hadn't really started development yet, or perhaps more accurately, I had made several runs at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Van_Pelt#Annual_football_strips"&gt;Lucy's football&lt;/a&gt; and wouldn't really have another go at it for some time. That made us both rather technically inclined, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't remember exactly how we began talking about Linux. But somehow we did, and as those conversations unfolded, I realized I had witnessed quite a bit of history as a desktop Linux user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm no neckbeard, mind you&amp;mdash;I'm not that old. I've yet to complete my third decade. I got into Linux in late 2007/early 2008, right as Ubuntu was really picking up steam. But still, that was &lt;em&gt;fifteen years ago,&lt;/em&gt; and a lot has happened in the Linux space in that span of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a moment, pull up a chair and listen to this first of many tales from the encompassing experiences of your Linux Grandpa. üêß üë¥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open that window&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody starts as a Linux user, and neither did I. My first computer ran Windows 2000 (or perhaps, Windows ME). It had dial-up internet, and was perched upon a desk made of a sheet of plywood sawn into an L and stacked on top of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_crate"&gt;milk crates&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually I wound up with an XP machine, and by this time, I had helped my dad build a computer or two, and I was old enough to begin taking a serious interest in the software that ran on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite curious about how the operating system actually worked. I was then and remain today oriented toward the bigger picture. It was this predilection that discouraged me from programming for many years, in fact. I thought I was cut out to be a system administrator, with that kind of a bent. At any rate, it was the OS layer that I found interesting, and as a youngster on Windows, poking around in the Control Panel gave a satisfying impression of how things worked. Then, I ascended to the monastic order of Power Users when I discovered the &lt;a href="http://dinesh.azurewebsites.net/hardwareandnetworking/Computer%20Networking%20-%20Lesson%208%20Administration_files/admintools1.gif"&gt;Administrative Tools&lt;/a&gt;. The Device Manager, the Registry&amp;mdash;it was all coming together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I hit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKY_Bh53YDE"&gt;the wall&lt;/a&gt;. You know, &lt;a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/ea3fd0e0-d478-47b3-9353-24449ab7a00e"&gt;the curtain&lt;/a&gt;. The point in Windows where you can't peer any further into how the system works, how it's put together. I hadn't begun to exhaust the secrets of Windows&amp;mdash;there are whole industries and hobbyist groups built around a deep understanding of how it works. But for a kid in his bedroom poking around inside Windows itself, I'd gone about as far as I could go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxJUN6MCnKM"&gt;I don't like apples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to turn to an alternative operating system, something that might let me have more of a peek under the hood. So I turned to the only other operating system I had heard of&amp;mdash;Mac OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all but immediately, I ran into a problem: I did not have a Mac, and Mac OS only comes on Macs. And being a gradeschooler, I did not have disposable income&amp;mdash;certainly not Apple levels of disposable income&amp;mdash;to spend on such a thing. So, I found another solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, I had my own laptop: a Toshiba Satellite A205-S5804. I still have it today&amp;mdash;I keep it as a relic of an age when Toshiba still made laptops. It has one of the best laptop keyboards I've ever used, not because it's especially good, but because back then laptop keyboards didn't suck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I remember that model number exactly is because I found a forum post that someone had written for making my &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; model of laptop into a Hackintosh. I dutifully followed those instructions, and sure enough, I had Mac OS (I believe this was Leopard, at the time) running on my laptop. And it took me all of perhaps a few days to tire of that ground-breaking experience, since Mac OS is locked down tighter than Windows is, especially when shoehorned onto non-Apple hardware. It was a novelty, but it was clear I wouldn't do or learn anything productive with such a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;African Names and Antarctic Mascots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointed and desperate, I took to the internet, hoping for some other option. I had heard whispers of a thing called Linux, but had read "Oh, it's just for servers" and the like. I discovered that there's no such thing as "a Linux", but there are &lt;em&gt;distributions&lt;/em&gt; of Linux. I didn't even really understand what a kernel was&amp;mdash;I just understood that it was the core around which all these other operating systems were built. It was a lot to muck through, but it was &lt;em&gt;there.&lt;/em&gt; The information was out there on the internet, and as long as I was willing, I could find it and read it and understand whatever I could, and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searches around which distro to start with were, by this point in history, turning up Ubuntu, a new distro that put some nice spit-and-polish on Debian and made it more usable. "&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/77gcn4/does_ubuntu_still_use_linux_for_human_beings_as/"&gt;Linux for human beings&lt;/a&gt;," they called it. It was named after an African word that everyone struggles to pronounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, this was late 2007/early 2008&amp;mdash;this date is made rather secure by the fact that my first Ubuntu version was 7.10, Gutsy Gibbon. You don't just forget your first Linux distro when it's called &lt;em&gt;Gutsy.&lt;/em&gt; When I first installed it, everything worked except the wireless card, a common problem back in those days. I had to use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ndis-wrapper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around the Windows driver to get it working. But on the following release, 8.04 Hardy Heron, it worked out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nice! It was new! It was interesting! And it was open&amp;mdash;a guarantee that any time spent trying to understanding this system would not be wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for the lessons I learned? Well &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparky"&gt;Sparky&lt;/a&gt;, that's a story for next time. For now, enjoy yourself a Werther's Original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(since this is the internet, it'll have to be an ASCII Original)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm James, and I've decided to start a dev blog. It's a bit of a clich√©, I know, but for me I think it will be a fruitful exercise. I like writing, and I've tried blogging over the years, but I've never really found a good fit for something to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming will be a good fit, I think. This is a new foray for me&amp;mdash;I've been doing development for about a year now, and my first big project at work is well on its way to rolling out next quarter. It's been exciting, and it's been a lot of work. But when I've been coding for 8-10 hours straight and I need a break, or when I need a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"&gt;rubber duck&lt;/a&gt;, or when I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to code but I shouldn't because I'm being obsessive, this will be a good outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to share insights of mine that might benefit you, dear reader. Expect opinions as well, and reaches into tech more broadly on occasion. Such excursions are inevitable, but I'm mostly interested in programming here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no need to belabor introductions, so I'll leave it at that. See you in whatever I write next!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Meta"></category></entry></feed>
