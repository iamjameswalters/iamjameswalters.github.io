  <p>People have a strange relationship with their software. Some applications are mainstays in our workplaces, but don't impact our lives off the clock. Some applications seemingly exist solely to annoy us. Many of us spend hours and hours with software designed to amuse us. Some of us wouldn't know how to live our lives without certain pieces of software. And it's increasingly ubiquitous--software drives our cars, controls our light bulbs, tells us how to get where we're going.</p>
<p>All of which brings up an interesting question to me...</p>
<h2>Do you like your software?</h2>
<p>It's not at all an obvious question. Many of us use software that we decidely do <em>not</em> like. Do you care for your banking app? How about your tax program? Does your email client ‚ú®Ô∏è spark joy? ‚ú®Ô∏è</p>
<p>My phone, for instance, is almost entirely devoid of any software that I like. I find phones to be incredibly infuriating computing devices. Web browsers on phones are hamstrung. Messaging apps are consternating on account of the sheer number of them you have to have installed in order to talk to anybody. My location app nags me <em>every. single. time.</em> that I open it, because I have battery optimization on. Sorry, I don't want you to destroy my battery life in order to find out where I am every second of the day when for the vast majority of the time I'm at my desk. Fast food apps break all the time, because someone thought it was a good idea for fast food companies to make software. And most apps I have installed like to spam me with ads every other day, so I have a constant stream of unwanted marketing getting pumped into my pocket.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that we use a lot of software we didn't ask for. No one who uses a 2FA app went scrolling through their app store and said, "Whoa, two factor authentication! I can't wait to get that set up!" You were told by your IT department, or a service that you use, that you have to install one or you won't be able to get on with things. (and yes, 2FA is a good thing, but you probably didn't choose to use it, did you?) </p>
<p>I absolutely never asked for an infotainment system in any car I've ever had, whether it's Apple Car Play or Android Auto, or whatever the auto maker's homegrown thing is. I was happy with my CD player, and these days, I'll just take the 1/8" AUX jack.</p>
<p>Everyday when I log onto my work computer, I have to sign into the VPN client. There's a bit of software I never asked to use. And I <em>certainly</em> didn't ask to use Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>But there is software that I <em>like!</em> I like Ubuntu MATE, my desktop PC's operating system. In fact, you could even call it <em>delight</em> when I see those three menus&mdash;Applications, Places, and System&mdash;at the top of my screen. I like Visual Studio Code, and I like VSCodium even better. I generally enjoy using GitHub. Is that because I'm usually achieving something when I am? ü§îÔ∏è</p>
<p>I like AntennaPod, a podcast app I found on FDroid. It lets me trim off the intro and outro music of podcasts, which wake me up when I'm trying to listen and fall asleep. I like RetroPie, it's a really nice bundle of software for playing all my old videogames (which, yes, I ripped off my catridges myself, but that's a story for another time). I like Nextcloud, it's a much nicer alternative to Google Drive that I felt comfortable using to share photos.</p>
<h2>Do you pay for your software?</h2>
<p>An interesting observation that I make time and time again is that the apps that actually run my life, the ones that I couldn't do without and are most valuable to me, are ones that I pay for. </p>
<p>A lot of software is available on some sort of freemium model, where it's ad-supported (YouTube) or you pay for it with your data (GMail). Those of us who love open source software often use it for free, without contributing back to the project. So it's interesting to me to consider that, where it counts, the wallet comes out. Things like my budget software simply have to work, and they have to work well.</p>
<p>I recently got an email from <a href="http://sourcery.ai/">Sourcery.ai</a>. They make an extension for VS Code that inspects my Python code and suggests refactorings and ways to write it better. I had started using it for free, but they're phasing out the free access and transitioning to a paid model only. As an existing user, they offered me the chance to buy a lifetime license. And you know what? I did.</p>
<p>Because I <em>like</em> Sourcery. It's helped me be a better programmer. Its feedback on the quality of functions helped me with a whole codebase at my job on a CLI tool I wrote. AI code assistants are about to be everywhere, and large language models like ChatGPT loom large in this space. Why pay for this then when free AI models exist and will only continue to proliferate? Because I <em>like</em> Sourcery, so I'm willing to pay for it.</p>
<h2>Should we use software that we don't like?</h2>
<p>I don't really have a point here. This is sort of an existential odyssey of thought. But that's kind of what bothers me, is how little we think about the software we use, and whether or not we <em>like</em> it. Shouldn't we be building tools and pieces of software that we enjoy to use?</p>
<p>It's a bit of a loaded question&mdash;there's always going to be that software that we don't ask for, the ATM interface or the gas pump screen or the self checkout station, et cetera. But in our products, at our jobs, and certainly in our leisure time, shouldn't we lobby for the software we like to use? That makes us more productive or effective? Perhaps even promotes human flourishing?</p>
