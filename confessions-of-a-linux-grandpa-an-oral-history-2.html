  <p>Hello again Sparky! Have you come for another story about the glory days of desktop Linux? Well who am I to disappoint? üë¥Ô∏è</p>
<p>Now, where did we leave off? Oh yes! I was running Ubuntu on the old Toshiba...</p>
<h2>Grandpa, what was Ubuntu like?</h2>
<p><img alt="Gutsy Gibbon" src="https://james.walters.click/images/ubuntu-7-10-gutsy.png"></p>
<p>This was Ubuntu, at the end of 2007. It was just then three years old. </p>
<p>It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_7.10_(Gutsy_Gibbon)">Gutsy</a>. It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy">human</a>. It was <span style="color: orange">orange</span>. </p>
<p>And, it made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL3c4l6G6pM">this sound</a> when you logged in.</p>
<p>What you're looking at there in terms of the desktop is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_2">GNOME 2</a>. It offered split panels, one at the top for application menus and launchers (as well as task bar applets), and one on the bottom for window management and virtual desktops. </p>
<p>Ah, how I <em>love</em> those menus&mdash;instead of cramming everything into one Start menu on Windows, here I had three distinct menus: one for applications, one for locations and folders on disk, and one for settings. üòôÔ∏èü§åÔ∏è</p>
<p>It came with Firefox 2, by the way.</p>
<p>I mentioned previously that my wireless card didn't work on this release: in order to get it working, I had to download the Windows driver from Realtek and install it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper"><code>ndis-wrapper</code></a>. This was a common problem in those days, it would be a few years before the wifi situation improved on Linux. As for this laptop, a driver would make its way into the kernel in the very next release&mdash;it worked out of the box in 8.04 Hardy Heron.</p>
<p>Speaking of installing stuff, there was no "app store" like there is these days, Ubuntu Software Centre [sic] or GNOME Software or whatever. Back then, you had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_(software)">Synaptic Package Manager</a>, which was itself rather new still. It is, essentially, a graphical browser of the packages in the repositories you were configured to use. I still install it on my machines today&mdash;it's quite handy to have around when you need to look at what's inside a metapackage or don't want to have to reach for <code>apt</code>.</p>
<h2>We called it "bling" ü•áÔ∏è</h2>
<p>As a devoted Linux user, I was eager to brandish that identity however I could. You might know of a little computer company in Denver called System76. They've certainly come along way over the last 15 years or so. Back in the day, they would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430063103/http://system76.com/article_info.php?articles_id=9">send you some free stickers</a> if you sent in a self-addressed envelope. They were a parody of the OS badges that computers came with that said "Powered by Windows XP" and the like. Here's what they looked like: </p>
<p><img alt="Powered by Ubuntu" src="https://james.walters.click/images/powered-by-ubuntu.png"></p>
<p>When I sent for mine, I received not only the OS badges, but also some Ubuntu logos for overlaying the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Windows key</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_key_(keyboard_button)">super key</a>. üòôÔ∏èü§åÔ∏è</p>
<p>They don't have the OS badges anymore, but System76 will <a href="https://system76.com/merch/stickers">still send you stickers today</a>.</p>
<p>I also went as far as to register this laptop on some list of registered Linux machines I found out there on the web. The home page would list how many registered Linux computers they were tracking. Of course, this was hardly scientific, it was entirely opt-in and who knows who had actually heard of it? I had discovered it through a badge in someone's forum signature containing their "ID number".</p>
<p>Alas, I'm afraid the name and URL of this site have long ago passed from Linux Grandpa's memory.</p>
<h2>On the Perils of Dual Booting</h2>
<p>I'll close by sharing an early blunder, perhaps my first with Linux.</p>
<p>After installing this and playing around with it for a bit, I decided that I wanted to go back to Windows (this laptop came with Vista). This was only my first foray into Linux, and while I enjoyed it, I was ready to return to the safety of home.</p>
<p>I hadn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_formatting#REFORMAT">nuked and paved</a> Windows; instead, I installed Ubuntu in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting#Microsoft_Windows_and_Linux">dual boot</a> setup. This meant that I split the disk into two partitions: one had Windows, the other Ubuntu. Going back to normal should be as simple as wiping out the Ubuntu side.</p>
<p>So, that's exactly what I did. And after completing that operation, I rebooted and...the computer couldn't boot.</p>
<p>The problem? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record">master boot record</a> (MBR) was pointing to something that didn't exist.</p>
<p>The master boot record was a little (512 bytes) sector that told the computer where to boot from. As computers (and kernels) grew to become larger and more complex, the MBR would just point to a bootloader, which would take care of the rest.</p>
<p>Originally, Windows had made the MBR point to its own bootloader. When I installed Ubuntu, it had to rewrite the MBR to point to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB"><code>GRUB</code></a>, which would offer boot options for both Ubuntu and Windows.</p>
<p>Well, when I wiped out my Ubuntu partition, I also wiped out GRUB, which meant that the MBR was pointing to something that didn't exist.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with a little Googling, this wasn't <em>too</em> difficult to fix: I reached for my trusty Windows install disc, and booted into the recovery utility. From there, I accessed some sort of recovery shell that let me run some command incantation involving a <code>/fixmbr</code> flag or something, and it repaired the MBR.</p>
<p>Of course, this was all long enough ago that computers still used MBRs&mdash;do we still use them on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Disk_device_compatibility">UEFI</a> machines? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
<p>At any rate, this was the first (not the last!) time I got myself out of a Linux pickle. At this early stage, it's a good thing I managed it&mdash;if I'd had to go groveling to my dad and have him fix my computer, he surely would have discouraged me from any further experiments.</p>
<p>That's all for this time, Sparky! As a reward for your attention, enjoy yourself another ASCII Original.</p>
