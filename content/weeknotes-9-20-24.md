Hello, dear reader! Let me tell you what's been going on this week.

#### New Laptop! üôåÔ∏è

I've got my new work laptop, and it's excellent! I've got a nice new Dell XPS 15 with an Intel i7-13620H, which Windows tells me has 10 real cores and 16 logical processors. I assume this means they aren't all hyperthreaded, only six of them are? Sounds like a big.Little thing. Anyway, it also has 32GB of RAM. It comes with Windows 11, but despite my being a [Linux Grandpa]({tag}Linux Grandpa), I've found it fairly inoffensive so far. Also, I've got WSL this time around! I've barely gotten to play with it yet, but I'm thrilled to do so soon.

The XPS is a nice machine, looks to be made of a fairly thick milled aluminum! It feels bulletproof. And whereas my old laptop built our Remix app in about 1m20s&mdash;1m40s, this machine does it in 2s. ü§óÔ∏è

It would sure be nice if I could manage to justify a [new keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCP6HLZR) I could carry around with this new laptop...

#### Back in the Office üè¢Ô∏è

Speaking of which, I had to go into the office to pick up this new machine, and I actually spent the day working there. I've needed a place where I can concentrate and get some work done, since my home is a busy place most days. I've been spending a lot of time out at coffee shops, but those can be just as distracting sometimes. My wonderful new headphones help, but not always entirely.

Also, when programming, there are too many times where what I really need is to step away for a few minutes and go for a walk. But of course, I can't do that and leave all my stuff at a coffee shop.

So, I decided to spend some more time at the office. It gives me a relatively quiet place to work, allows me to step away from my things without concern, and I get the added bonus of not having to faff with the VPN.

While there, I got to enjoy my smalltown downtown in a way I haven't done since the pre-pandemic days. Our town is on a riverfront, and I went and had my lunch down there. Afterwards, I popped into the local candy store. I have uncanny luck for walking in at the precise moment where they're pressing cinnamon red hots, and offering samples (still warm!).

#### Joining the Choir üé∂Ô∏è

My church puts together a choir about once per quarter, and I joined this time around. It's been very rewarding to use a lot of musical mental muscles I'd forgotten were there! It's been challenging to use a lot of vocal muscles that have been neglected. üòÖÔ∏è

On a related note, I also bought a new hymnal recently. Perhaps I'll discuss that soon.
