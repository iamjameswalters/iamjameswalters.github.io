I've been working on an internal web app at my job for our call and chat agents. There's some text provided there that agents commonly need to copy and paste. I thought it might be nice to write a bit of scripting to automatically copy these bits of text to the clipboard when the text is selected, without having to Ctrl-C.

After perusing the web, the obvious answer seemed to be to use the [clipboard API](https://devdocs.io/dom/clipboard). In order to copy text, you would just write something like: 

```javascript
navigator.clipboard.writeText("text I want to copy")
```

And indeed, this will work in something like 90% of your usecases. I ran into an edge case though.

## Let Me Stop You Right There üõëÔ∏è

You see, the use of the clipboard API requires a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). What exactly does that mean? It's probably a bit more nuanced than this, but _basically_ it means you need to be connecting over HTTPS.

Remember how I mentioned this was an **internal** web app? We access it unencrypted. That means the clipboard API won't work. üò©Ô∏è

Is there any other way?

## I'll Copy Whatever I Darn Well Please 

It turns out there kind of is.
