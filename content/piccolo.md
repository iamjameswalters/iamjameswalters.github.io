Hi! I'd like to show-and-tell a little project. üòÅÔ∏è

I'm rather fond of classless CSS libraries. You just link them in your document, and they style everything. That means they aren't really customizable, but the point is to just allow you to get something looking really nice rather quickly, without having to fuss with the styles. They're great for proofs of concept or demos of in-progress work. It's always disappointing to hammer out some backend logic, only to meet with a blank stare from someone because they aren't impressed by your ugly bare page. This alleviates that.

One such library is [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/), which comes in a [classless variant](https://picocss.com/docs/classless.html).

This blog is built with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/), a Python static site generator. When I first got it going, I thought it'd be fun to put together my own Pelican theme. And I thought it would be easy enough to throw one together with Pico&mdash;it would look nice, and I could spend most of my time learning how Pelican puts together sites, and less time worrying about style decisions.

The result is [Piccolo](https://github.com/iamjameswalters/piccolo), a Pelican theme based on Pico.css. **And you're looking at it!**

You might wonder, if I've been using this theme for the blog the entire time, why I'm only talking about it now. The reason is it was recently merged into the excellent [pelican-themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) repository, and is now featured at [pelicanthemes.com](http://pelicanthemes.com/). Awesome!

Do you run a Pelican site? Have you been looking at playing with a static site generator? Feel free to kick the tires on Piccolo. If you find any ways it can be improved, please [open an issue](https://github.com/iamjameswalters/piccolo/issues), I'll take a look. üßêÔ∏è
