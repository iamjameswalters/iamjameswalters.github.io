Hello, hello! Just a few things this week:

#### Gaming Again üéÆÔ∏è

I've spent some time playing a few videogames lately, a pastime I've had very little time for in this phase of life. Accordingly, I'm not going to call myself a "gamer" in any sense recognizable in the modern world. But, I'll you what I've been playing.

Mostly, that's been Super Mario Wonder, which is a complete and total delight of a game. I've had a blast with it everytime I've picked it up. They've done such a delightful job at making this game centered not so much around the completion of obstacle courses, but discoveries. Some pipes you can push, some of them go up and down like a teeter-totter. Some of them take you into the background of the level. Special Wonder Flowers take you down an Alice in Wonderland rabbithole and transform the course into something on another plane.

There are new powers too (such as the flagship elephant power), but they aren't gimmicks thrown in to justify making a new 2D Mario platformer. It's one of the most exciting games I've played in years. In the long run, it might just surpass Mario Odyssey as my favorite Switch game.

And I can't help but be delighted at the Captain Toad cameos&mdash;and hopeful that this means Nintendo hasn't forgotten about him? üëÄÔ∏è

###### Echoes of Wisdom

But the big news is the new Zelda game that just came out yesterday&mdash;and this time it really is a *Zelda* game! The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a new 2D platformer (or is it? more in a moment) where you actually get to play as the titular princess for once. Set in the beautiful and engaging visual style of the Link's Awakening remake from a few years back (by the excellent folks at Grezzo, to whom I dearly hope Nintendo continues to give remake projects&mdash;come on, [Oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages)!), this game has you casting "echoes" of things you've encountered along the way: boxes, tables, bed, trampolines, even moblins. 

I cracked it open just last night, and it looks like a brilliant port of Tears of the Kingdom's out of the box [TIMTOWTDI](https://wiki.c2.com/?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt=) puzzle philosophy to the 2D dungeon crawling genre. After playing it some, I'm actually not convinced that this is a purely 2D game. It's not [2.5D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D) in the way it's traditionally understood, but it's something orthogonal to it. If it's not a 3D game, you're certainly approaching it. You're definitely walking around within a 2D plane, and this is no more true than in the many sidescrolling sections, a gameplay element with only a few instances in Link's Awakening, but which has already made more appearances here in Echoes before the first dungeon's even over with (and yes, this game has dungeons!). However, because of the way that you now have access to higher points (through building towers of tables and beds and crates) and lower points (through diving, etc.) in the environment, it encourages you to think of the place as not so neatly cut up into different "floors" anymore (a strict idiom of the 2D games of yore).

But there really is this restriction to a 2D plane that sort of reigns in the excesses of BotW/TotK's physics-sandbox puzzle solving. I won't offer much critique of TotK because I've barely played it (sorry, busy these days!), but despite some gripes I was much more optimistic overall about the way TotK encouraged you to solve problems _creatively._ In Echoes, that creative problem solving out of building blocks you've already seen is center stage, but without the complexity of a full 3D physics engine, everything seems more straightforward to reason about. And, that means you can't make "shrines" or other areas that are purely physics puzzles&mdash;because you can't make the physics sandbox the main attraction, you still have to build a traditional maze and dungeon, which requires at least a certain level of _logical_ puzzle solving. The result so far is feeling like a perfect blend of both: individual screens or rooms where I have to creatively use echoes to scale a wall or surpass as challenging to get to the next room, but all of these rooms are part of a larger dungeon that you have to reason through. It's shaping up to be a rich and powerful combination.

We're light on story so far, but that's to be expected from Nintendo these days, and I'm not holding this game out to be big lore builder. But who knows? Maybe they'll surprise me.

8/10 so far from me, and I've barely started, so I'm sure that might tick up another notch!

#### Settling in at the Office üè¢Ô∏è

After a few weeks, I'm really settling into my office workflow. My former desk was adjacent to the main aisle, which was more than a little distracting. So, I stuffed myself over in an unoccupied corner where I finally found a cubicle with internet (our IT folks cleaned up the patch panel after everyone left the office!). It happened to have a pair of pretty nice monitors sitting there! After scavenging the right cables from some other desks, I've got a pretty nice dual screen setup. üòéÔ∏è

I also got spousal approval to begin shopping for a mechanical keyboard to accompany this setup. I'm also looking at a mouse kit that comes with all the hardware and you 3D print an enclosure. Interested to peruse some of the available designs!

All in all, it's been quite good. I don't want a permanent return to office, but having the flexibility to use that environment when it's advantageous to me is really nice.

See you next week!
