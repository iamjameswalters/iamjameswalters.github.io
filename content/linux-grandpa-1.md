### Let me spin you a yarn... üß∂ üë¥

I'm known to at least one friend as his "Linux grandpa" (I'm fairly certain I coined this phrase myself). We met while working together at my current company. He was (and is) a sharp developer. I hadn't really started development yet, or perhaps more accurately, I had made several runs at [Lucy's football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Van_Pelt#Annual_football_strips) and wouldn't really have another go at it for some time. That made us both rather technically inclined, however.

I don't remember exactly how we began talking about Linux. But somehow we did, and as those conversations unfolded, I realized I had witnessed quite a bit of history as a desktop Linux user.

Now, I'm no neckbeard, mind you&mdash;I'm not that old. I've yet to complete my third decade. I got into Linux in late 2007/early 2008, right as Ubuntu was really picking up steam. But still, that was *fifteen years ago,* and a lot has happened in the Linux space in that span of time. 

So, if you have a moment, pull up a chair and listen to this first of many tales from the encompassing experiences of your Linux Grandpa. üêß üë¥

### Open that window

Nobody starts as a Linux user, and neither did I. My first computer ran Windows 2000 (or perhaps, Windows ME). It had dial-up internet, and was perched upon a desk made of a sheet of plywood sawn into an L and stacked on top of [milk crates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_crate). Eventually I wound up with an XP machine, and by this time, I had helped my dad build a computer or two, and I was old enough to begin taking a serious interest in the software that ran on them.

I was quite curiious about how the operating system actually worked. I was then and remain today oriented toward the bigger picture. It was this predilection that discouraged me from programming for many years, in fact. I thought I was cut out to be a system administrator, with that kind of a bent. At any rate, it was the OS layer that I found interesting, and as a youngster on Windows, poking around in the Control Panel gave a satisfying impression of how things worked. Then, I ascended to the monastic order of Power Users when I discovered the [Administrative Tools](http://dinesh.azurewebsites.net/hardwareandnetworking/Computer%20Networking%20-%20Lesson%208%20Administration_files/admintools1.gif). The Device Manager, the Registry&mdash;it was all coming together.

But then, I hit [the wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKY_Bh53YDE). You know, [the curtain](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/ea3fd0e0-d478-47b3-9353-24449ab7a00e). The point in Windows where you can't peer any further into how the system works, how it's put together. I hadn't begun to exhaust the secrets of Windows&mdash;there are whole industries and hobbyist groups built around a deep understanding of how it works. But for a kid in his bedroom poking around inside Windows itself, I'd gone about as far as I could go.

### [I don't like apples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxJUN6MCnKM)

It was time to turn to an alternative operating system, something that migth let me have more of a peek under the hood. So I turned to the only other operating system I had heard of&mdash;Mac OS.

Now, all but immediately, I ran into a problem: I did not have a Mac, and Mac OS only comes on Macs. And being a gradeschooler, I did not have disposable income&mdash;certainly not Apple levels of disposable income&mdash;to spend on such a thing. So, I found another solution.

By this time, I had my own laptop: a Toshiba Satellite A205-S5804. I still have it today&mdash;I keep it as a relic of an age when Toshiba still made laptops. It has one of the best laptop keyboards I've ever used, not because it's especially good, but because back then laptop keyboards didn't suck. 

The reason I remember that model number exactly is because I found a forum post that someone had written for making my *exact* model of laptop into a Hackintosh. I dutifully followed those instructions, and sure enough, I had Mac OS (I believe this was Leopard, at the time) running on my laptop. And it took me all of perhaps a few days to tire of that ground-breaking experience, since Mac OS is locked down tighter than Windows is, especially when shoehorned onto non-Apple hardware. It was a novelty, but it was clear I wouldn't do or learn anything productive with such a machine.

### African Names and Antarctic Mascots

Disappointed and desperate, I took to the internet, hoping for some other option. I had heard whispers of a thing called Linux, but had read "Oh, it's just for servers" and the like. I discovered that there's no such thing as "a Linux", but there are *distributions* of Linux. I didn't even really understand what a kernel was&mdash;I just understood that it was the core around which all these other operating systems were built. It was a lot to muck through, but it was _there._ The information was out there on the internet, and as long as I was willing, I could find it and read it and understand whatever I could, and keep going.

Searches around which distro to start with were, by this point in history, turning up Ubuntu, a new distro that put some nice spit-and-polish on Debian and made it more usable. "[Linux for human beings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/77gcn4/does_ubuntu_still_use_linux_for_human_beings_as/)," they called it. It was named after an African word that everyone struggles to pronounce.

As I said above, this was late 2007/early 2008&mdash;this date is made rather secure by the fact that my first Ubuntu version was 7.10, Gutsy Gibbon. You don't just forget your first Linux distro when it's called *Gutsy.* When I first installed it, everything worked except the wireless card, a common problem back in those days. I had to use [`ndis-wrapper`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper) around the Windows driver to get it working. But on the following release, 8.04 Hardy Heron, it worked out of the box.

It was nice! It was new! It was interesting! And it was open&mdash;a guarantee that any time spent trying to understanding this system would not be wasted.

And as for the lessons I learned? Well [Sparky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparky), that's a story for next time. For now, enjoy yourself a Werther's Original. 

Since this is the internet, it'll have to be an ASCII Original.
