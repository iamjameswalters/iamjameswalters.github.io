Title: Oh no, not another dev blog

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm James, and I've decided to start a dev blog. It's a bit of a clichÃ©, I know, but for me I think it will be a fruitful exercise. I like writing, and I've tried blogging over the years, but I've never really found a good fit for something to talk about.

Programming will be a good fit, I think. This is a new foray for me--I've been doing development for about a year now, and my first big project at work is well on its way to rolling out next quarter. It's been exciting, and it's been a lot of work. But when I've been coding for 8-10 hours straight and I need a break, or when I need a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), or when I *want* to code but I shouldn't because I'm being obsessive, this will be a good outlet.

I hope to share insights of mine that might benefit you, dear reader. Expect opinions as well, and reaches into tech more broadly on occasion. Such excursions are inevitable, but I'm mostly interested in programming here.

There's no need to belabor introductions, so I'll leave it at that. See you in whatever I write next!
